# Netflix frontend remake

Personal remake of the Netflix frontend webapp using React.
This project has been an effective way to practice core frontend principles like :

-   building a fully responsive webpage
-   fetching data from API & updating frontend
-   building reusable & maintainable components
-   further understanding of React hooks (useState, useEffect...)
