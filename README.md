# Netflix frontend remake

Personal remake of the Netflix frontend webapp using React.
This project has been an effective way to practice core frontend principles like :
- building a fully responsive webpage
- fetching data from API & updating frontend
- building reusable & maintainable components
- further understanding of React hooks (useState, useEffect...)
